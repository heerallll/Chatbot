# Chatbot


This project is a simple rule-based chatbot built using Python. It uses basic `if-else` conditions to respond to predefined user inputs. The chatbot can recognize greetings, simple questions, and end conversations when the user says "bye". It is implemented on a terminal or any Python IDE and does not require external libraries. The project helps build a foundation in natural language processing, logic building, and user interaction design. Although basic, it provides insight into how more advanced AI chatbots work and is a great starting point for understanding chatbot flow and decision-making based on user input.
